## Updates as I go along, most recent at the top
### 25 June 2025
Change to start with data at BCO-DMO and use Python script to go from BCO-DMO repository to a format required by CMAP.

### 23/24 June 2025
Using ``makeCMAP.R`` to convert the BIOS-SCOPE data into a worksheet with the three tabs expected by CMAP. Updated after I read through the dataset submission details, only minor edits so far. I need to get some details on the various instruments before proceeding.

#### To do
- [ ] need more details on measurement and instruments
- [ ] pass validation at CMAP
