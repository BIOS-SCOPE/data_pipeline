## Updates as I go along, most recent at the top

Using ``makeCMAP.R`` to convert the BIOS-SCOPE data into a worksheet with the three tabs expected by CMAP. Updated after I read through the dataset submission details, only minor edits so far. I need to get some details on the various instruments before proceeding.

#### To do
- [ ] need more details on measurement and instruments
- [ ] where did the short names at BCO-DMO come from?
- [ ] pass validation at CMAP
- [ ] started canvas in Slack in preparation for group meeting re: details
