# data_pipeline 
Updated 28 January 2025; Krista Longnecker 

The repository was started during a small group meeting for the BIOS-SCOPE project. BIOS-SCOPE conducts multiple cruises and relies on samples and data collected during BATS cruises. The data streams include CTD data and discrete samples. The CTD data are used to calculate derived variables. The data from the discrete samples is pulled together with the CTD data to create a 'master_bottle_file' for everyone to use. This GtiHub repository discusses the CTD data and discrete data files. If you are interested in the data-portal being developed to link in the sequence data, that is available [here](https://github.com/BIOS-SCOPE/data-portal).

The remainder of this repository describes how this is done, provides details and code from different people, and ends with a to-do list for each member of this small group.

Details on the scripts are covered either in the PDF presented [here](https://github.com/BIOS-SCOPE/data_pipeline/blob/main/BIOSSCOPE_dataPipeline_LongneckerEtAl.pdf) or in this figure:

## After a cruise 
* The CTD data goes to Craig Carlson to serve as an archive; no work is done on these files.
* The BATS team processes the CTD data and posts it on Dropbox. As of fall 2023, Craig and Rachel have access to the processed data on BIOS-SCOPE.
* Rachel moves the processed CTD data onto the BIOS-SCOPE Google Drive. Data will be here in the BIOS-SCOPE Google Drive:\
```./1.0 DATA/1.0 ORIG CTD FROM BATS```\
```./CTDrelease_20230626  (these begin with “1” or “2”)```\
```./BIOS-SCOPE Cruises  (these begin with “9”)```

## Step 1: Download CTD files from BIOS-SCOPE Google drive
To work on the CTD data, get the data from the BIOS-SCOPE Google Drive. This is best done in batches, where each 'batch' is CTD data from multiple cruises, possibly over multiple years. You will need to process data from BATS cruises separately from BIOSSCOPE cruises.
 
On Google Drive you will find subfolders for each cruise. Each subfolder contains various ascii files (one per each CTD cast, plus the physf_QC and MLD.dat files). Go into the CTDrelease_20230626 and highlight the cruise folders that are new --> download them to a zip file.\
Make a processing folder (e.g., BIOSSCOPE_working) and move the downloaded zip archives there. Unzip the files. 

## Step 2: Shuting's pipeline (in R)
This file was updated by Krista (January 2024), the update modified Shuting's code to go through a series of folders to find new CTD data. The code will require you to indicate if you are working on 'BATS' data or 'BIOSSCOPE' data (at line 30). The updated R file is [Join_BATS_All_with_master_v3.R](https://github.com/BIOS-SCOPE/data_pipeline/blob/main/R_code/Join_BATS_All_with_master_v3.R), and you can click the link to see the file on GitHub. 

The code now does the following (after data files have been downloaded from Google Drive as described above:
* read in the current master file (```BATS_BS_COMBINED_MASTER_latest.xlsx```) and then use that to set the headers for the data incoming data
* get the headers that are used on the BATS CTD data files
* Go through one cruise at a time and
    * read in the ```BIOSSCOPE_physf``` file
    * delete the columns we do not want and rename columns as needed
    * get the cast and Niskin information from the New_ID
    * add in the nominal depths
    * resize everything so it can be pasted into the existing bottle file
* Repeat for all cruises and open the end result as an Excel file (this will happen automatically when you run the R script)

Now you have to do some manual copy/paste:
* Use copy/paste to append the new rows at the end of the BIOS-SCOPE master file
* Update the log in the master file
* Save the file with a new date

## Step 3: Ruth Curry's pipeline (in MATLAB)
Once Shuting's code has been used to add the necessary samples to the master bottle file, then you can run Ruth's code to calculate the derived variables. 

Krista has updated [create_biosscope_files_2024_Krista.m ](https://github.com/BIOS-SCOPE/data_pipeline/blob/main/MATLAB_code/create_biosscope_files_2024_Krista.m ) to pick up where the previous processing script ended. This file will start with 10390 (March 2022) and then go to 10404 (May 2023). The path information is set for Krista's desktop, this would need to be updated for other computers.

One special note about season transition dates. There is now an Excel file ```BATS_seasons_wKLedits.2024.07.05.xlsx``` and the MATLAB code is now set to read in that file and convert it to the format used by Ruth. 

Generally the rest of the code does the following:
*	Loads CTD files from BATS, labels them with physical framework parameters
*	Outputs CSV and MAT files
*	Reads Master bottle file, creates structure with added fields
*	Loops through bottle data cruise by cruise, matches the corresponding CTD cast, computes a set derived physical properties and adds the values to the bottle cast
*	The end result is a file that is called ```ADD_to_MASTER_temporary.csv``` which is saved to a holding zone
 
The next step is to use ```Join_discreteData_v3.R``` to add the calculated variables to the existing bottle file.

Once a set of CTD data has been processed, you don't need to redo the MATLAB steps unless the data gets reprocessed by BATS.

## Step 4: Merge in discrete dataset as it becomes available (in R)
You will always have the calculated variables from Ruth's code, and there will be other datases as they become available (e.g., nutrients, Shimadzu data, cell counts, and more). One important note: the merge is done based on **New_ID**, so the new datafile must have a column with the new ID (begins in 1,2, or 9). There is an example file in the data_holdingZone folder (```sampleDataFile_useAsExampleForYourData.xlsx```) so you can see the format needed for an Excel file holding new data. New data can be in an Excel file or a CSV file. 

Krista updated Shuting's code (new available [Join_discreteData_v3.R](https://github.com/BIOS-SCOPE/data_pipeline/blob/main/R_code/Join_discreteData_v3.R)). Generally the new script does the following:
* reads in the current bottle file
* reads in the discrete data file to be added to the existing bottle file
    * checks to see if there are duplicate samples in the incoming discrete data file
    * asks the user if this is expected
         * if it is expected, the script will average the samples to provide one value for each sample
         * if it is not expected, the script will cancel with an error message so the user can see what happened
* matches the column names between the existing file and the temporary columns in the new file
* opens up the full set of discrete data as an Excel worksheet

At this point, you do have to do some manual copy/pasting:
* Copy the entire worksheet that will open in Excel when the R code is done
* Paste into the existing discrete file
* Get the headers with the proper colors - this is the first row in the 'Bottle File Header' worksheet.
* Update the log and save the discrete file with a new date.

:star: :star: **New --> February 2025**\
Upload this new discrete file back to the BIOS-SCOPE (working) Google Drive. To do this and still retain the links do the following:
* Put a copy of the latest file into the 'old versions' folder with a date (I would put the old file on the BIOS-SCOPE Team drive, but that's just my two cents)
* Right click on the latest file in the BIOS-SCOPE Working Google Drive
* Scroll down to File Information, and then Manage Versions
* Select 'upload new version' from the menu box that will come up.

## Craig's need for a synoptic profile for each BATS cruise
Craig currently working in R to make one single cast for each cruise so we can pull in data from pumps etc.
For the data portal, using these synpotic casts, the idea is to use cast and nominal depth as the key for merging.
Krista has Craig's code and is working on this in a separate GitHub repository (7/11/2024)

## Calculating derived variables from BATS data
#### updated July 2024
Krista made a new repository to do the calculations on the historical BATS data (BATSallTime) because it's too confusing to do the changes needed to make the historical BATS calculations in the same place as the code needed to merge R/MATLAB for future BATS cruises.

## tasks to-do list
Ruth
- [ ] put glider data and metadata into BCO-DMO format
